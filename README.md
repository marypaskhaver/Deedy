# Good-Deed-Counter

This is the third app I am working on in Swift. 

While making this app, I learned about how to save user data with Core Data and use UINavigationBar and UIBarButtonItem in my classes to change my app's theme. I also bettered my understanding of the AppDelegate class.

I'll be adding on to this project over the summer, so keep an eye out for new features. :)
