# Good-Deed-Counter

While making this app, I learned about how to save and user data with Core Data, as well as how to query databases to get entities based on their attributes. Additionally, I've used UINavigationBar and UIBarButtonItem in my classes to change my app's theme. I also bettered my understanding of the AppDelegate class.

I'll be adding on to this project over the summer, so keep an eye out for new features. :)
