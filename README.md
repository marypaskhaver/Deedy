# Good-Deed-Counter

While making this app, I learned how to:
- Change the positions of objects on my screen based off user input
- Create, remove, update, and destroy user data with Core Data
- Query databases to get entities based on their attributes 
- Use UINavigationBar and UIBarButtonItem in my classes to change my app's theme 
- Use the AppDelegate class to change my app's appearance 
- Use the AppDelegate class to send the user daily notifications
- Create custom views to create spacing between TableView cells
- Use protocols and delegates to send data between ViewControllers

I'll be adding on to this project over the summer, so keep an eye out for new features. :)
